    <h3>Amos’ Summary:</h3>
    <p>
        Amos Aguilera is a 6'4", 200‑pound first baseman from Fontana, CA, with a tall, projectable frame and room to add strength. A multi‑sport athlete competing in basketball and wrestling, he brings athleticism, 
        coordination, and toughness to the baseball field. Defensively, he has soft hands, solid footwork, and a strong feel for the glove, making him a reliable presence at first base. His short arm action leads to 
        accurate throws, and with further development—particularly by driving through his target—he can add more velocity.<br/><br/>
        At the plate, Aguilera is a right‑handed hitter with a slightly open stance and a small leg lift trigger for timing. His rotational swing and strong hands generate solid bat speed, allowing him to drive the 
        ball into the gaps. With further refinement—such as incorporating a deeper hand load and working through the ball more efficiently—he has the potential to unlock even greater power. His multi‑sport background enhances his strength, agility, and competitiveness, making him a well‑rounded athlete with significant upside as he continues to develop.
